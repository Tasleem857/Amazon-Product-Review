On my first try for this product i tried using mccain potato cubes in this. I started the fryer, and wall was going great for 4-5 mins until suddenly the heating light went off, i thought it was a cycle thing, but 10-15 sec later , the power light went off while the timer was still running as it is spring based. I tried to take the container out and re-insert it. the power and heating lights went online, and that is when i realised as i left the handle that these were pressure based and as soon as i left the pressure on the handle , there might have been a connection problem due to loose grip, the lights went off again. I gave it 2-3 more tries , normally holding it thinking it was a one off thing. But the same happened over and over again. Then i immediately ordered a return which was quick.. Although there was a problem in the piece, i lost the interest in the product itself, the potato bites did actually get cooked properly, but i lost the trust in the mechanism.

Product got delivered on evening of 27July 2019 yesterday and opened this morning 28th. Tried cooking french fries and the product worked flawlessly for the first 10 mins. As after 10 mins, I had to shake the fries, it stopped working and took lots of adjustment which was a mood spoiler. The next lot i.e. third time it stopped working at all and it's all due to poor mechanism.. To summarise:. - Product is easy to use and clean provided it's in use.. -If it works well, don't expect it to be a lasting product as build quality is filmsy.. - The unlock mechanism of fryer is faulty and can lead to unlocking of fryer from base and base will fall down too while removing contents..

It got delivered in a day. To my utter disappointment, the air fryer stopped working on the first day itself. It was simply dead. I ordered replacement and the replacement air fryer came in another 24 hours. I was kinda sceptical at this point and tried the air fryer, immediately after it arrived. To my surprise, it had few minor scratches here and there but I paid least attention towards them and tried using the air fryer. It worked! I am writing this review after around 2-3 months of usage and can say that it is working quite nicely. Have made many dishes and the experience has been good. It's not very good when it comes to deep fried items like Pakora or Samosas but it definitely is a good replacement for normal shallow frying and grilling.

So far we have made chips, roasted veggies, cutlets, pizza, and cake. For some items you might need to oil the base a little more.. Ideally you can place an piece of foil to collect the excess oil which can prevent the oil from spoiling the base. Try to clean the fryer once it's cooled down but still a little hot. This will make it easier to get the oil out.. The size is about half the width of a common microwave.. The manual timer can sometimes glitch so you need to be careful that you keep an eye on it.",4.0 out of 5 stars

Courier guy delivered the item at the security gate of residential complex after discussing with me but reported as ‘delivered direct to customer’ which isn’t appropriate.. About item- Bought to have an initial experience of an air fryer. Product doesn’t seem to be of acceptable standards. Even at highest temp i.e. 200 degrees and using as per the recommended time, the food (eg thin home fries) couldn’t get crispy or tender. The demo provided by company isn’t satisfactory as the demo guy himself doesn’t know much about its working. Build quality is also very much average.
